                    <p class="mb-4">A Public Limited Company stands as the preferred choice for medium to large-scale
                        businesses in India looking to raise funds from the public. Its primary advantage lies in its
                        ability to raise capital by issuing shares through an IPO (Initial Public Offering), providing a
                        higher level of transparency in business operations compared to other entities. However, setting up
                        a Public LTD. Co. entails stricter requirements than a Private Limited Company.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        A Public LTD. Co. must have a minimum of 7 members, with no upper limit on membership. It
                        distinguishes its operations from ownership significantly and holds the exclusive ability to list
                        its shares on major Indian stock exchanges like NSE (National Stock Exchange) and BSE (Bombay Stock
                        Exchange).
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Separate Legal Entity: Enjoying distinct identity, a PLC can operate independently, hold bank
                            accounts, obtain licenses, hire employees, and enter contracts under its name.</li>
                        <li>Perpetual Existence: The company continues to exist until legally dissolved, unaffected by
                            changes in directorship or ownership.</li>
                        <li>Share Transfer and Ownership: Shares can be easily transferred, simplifying ownership changes
                            with the approval of shareholders.</li>
                        <li>Property Ownership: A PLC, as a separate entity, can own and sell property under its name,
                            securing it from claims by individual directors.</li>
                        <li>Borrowing Capacity: Financial institutions prefer lending to a PLC over other entities,
                            providing various fundraising options like public deposits, debentures, and equity shares.</li>
                    </ul>

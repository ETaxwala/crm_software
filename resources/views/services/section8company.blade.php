                    <p class="mb-4">A Section 8 company is a registered Non-Profit Organization (NPO) functioning as a
                        corporation. Its primary objective is to promote various sectors such as arts, commerce, charity,
                        education, and environmental protection. Profits or income generated are exclusively utilized to
                        further these objectives. Although it operates similarly to a limited company with corresponding
                        rights and obligations, a key distinction is that it is prohibited from using the terms "Section 8"
                        or "Limited" in its name.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        These entities are registered under the Companies Act and are treated as limited companies without
                        the inclusion of the term "limited" in their names, whether initially registered as private or
                        public limited companies.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Section 8 Companies are a legal structure for Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) or Non-Governmental
                        Organizations (NGOs), granting them the right to operate nationwide.

                    <p class="mb-4">Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) Registration is especially suitable for small and
                        medium-sized businesses, offering a blend of features from Private Limited Companies and traditional
                        Partnerships.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        An LLP is established under the LLP Act, 2008. Unlike a traditional partnership, in an LLP, partners
                        aren’t held liable for each other's misconduct. This structure also provides partners with limited
                        liability protection. Notably, LLP partners can directly manage the business, making it an appealing
                        incorporation choice.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Separate Legal Entity: </strong> An LLP is an independent entity capable of contracting
                            and legal action.
                            Each partner isn't held liable for the actions of others.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Limited Liability: </strong> Partners' personal assets are safeguarded in case of
                            liquidation, except in
                            cases of proven fraud. Partners are liable only for their invested amount.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Perpetual Existence: </strong> An LLP continues to exist despite changes in ownership or
                            partner
                            departures.
                        </li>


                        <li><strong>Unified Ownership and Management: </strong> Partners manage and own the LLP, unlike in
                            Private Limited
                            Companies where shareholders and directors may differ.</li>

                        <li><strong>No Mandatory Audit: </strong> LLPs with a capital contribution below 25 lakh rupees and
                            turnover less than
                            40 lakh rupees are exempt from mandatory audits, making it favorable for startups and small
                            businesses.</li>

                        <li><strong>Flexible Agreement: </strong> Partners have liberty in drafting agreements related to
                            their roles and
                            rights.</li>

                        <li><strong>Property Ownership: </strong> An LLP, as a juristic person, can own and transact
                            property under its name.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Reduced Compliance: </strong> LLPs have minimal annual compliance requirements, reducing
                            operational
                            complexities.</li>

                        <li><strong>Ease of Closure: </strong> Starting and winding up an LLP is simpler compared to a
                            private limited
                            company.</li>

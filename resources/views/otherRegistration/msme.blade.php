                    <p class="mb-4">MSME Registration is highly advantageous for Micro, Small, and Medium-sized
                        enterprises, providing various benefits like tax exemptions and capital investment opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Businesses falling under the MSME (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) category are required to
                        register under the MSMED (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development) Act, 2006. These
                        enterprises contribute significantly to a nation's economic growth by creating income opportunities.
                        While MSME Registration is not mandatory by law, it proves beneficial for enterprises, enabling them
                        to access perks such as excise duty exemptions, power tariff subsidies, lower interest rates, tax
                        subsidies, and capital investment subsidies.
